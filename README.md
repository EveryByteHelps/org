##FAQ

###<a name="geninfo"/> Background Information

#### What is Every Byte Helps?

<!-- Generally speaking, we work with nonprofits or local government in three month blocks, building apps or websites that serve their needs. Who we work with and what issues we address are determined at our annual CodeAcross Denver event, scheduled at the beginning of the year. To stay on top of the things throughout the year, we host regular meetups (weekly and bi-weekly) to manage things and work on current projects. -->


#### How do you differ from other code for X organizations?

<!-- Though we are part of Code for Americas Brigade, Code for Denver is more of an independent and locally-focused organization. As such, we are not given any guidelines to follow regarding how we operate or the like, but we do receive some sponsorship from Code for America. -->

###<a name="everyone"/>For Everyone


#### So how do I get involved?

<!-- Start by joining our Meetup.com group at www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver. This is where we list all of our upcoming meetings and events. Planning meetings are weekly (when in season) and hack nights are bi-weekly. RSVP or just drop by and say hello. -->

#### How many people are working on a project at any given time?

It varies depending on interest level.
<!-- This varies according the circumstances and there are no hard and fast rules that set a minimum or maximum number of volunteers per project. For the sake of efficiency, our broader goal is to focus the efforts of all volunteers on whatever project were currently working on. -->

#### Is there any one person who is typically in charge of projects?

We would like to have a liason between our group and the particular organization
that we are serving for a project.  We understand that this may not
work for all projects and will treat this on a case-by-case basis.

#### What tools do you use?

Currently, our toolbox includes the following items.

* Software: [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Version Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/)/[Github](https://github.com/everybytehelps)
* Story management: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)
* Documentation/Technical writing: [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/)

Dont worry if you're unfamiliar with any of these tools. Well help you get up and running.

#### Who can I contact for additional questions?

Get in touch with our organizers Ryan Elmore or Matt Pocernich or drop us a line
at everybytehelps[at]gmail.com.  This group grew out of the R Meetup, so we're likely to be
there if you don't know how to get in touch with us.

<!-- ### <a name="noncoders"/>For Non-coders

####I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, nonprofits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down! -->

<!-- #### Where do we keep project docs, and how do we collaborate?

See our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/codefordenver/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. -->

### <a name="datascis"/>For Data Scientists

#### I'm a beginner data scientist. Can I still get involved?

Hell yes!
